## Getting Started

[TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/) (Formerly LambdaTest) is the world's first full-stack AI Agentic Quality Engineering platform that empowers teams to test intelligently, smarter, and ship faster. Built for scale, it offers a full-stack testing cloud with 10K+ real devices and 3,000+ browsers. With AI-native test management, MCP servers, and agent-based automation, TestMu AI supports Selenium, Appium, Playwright, and all major frameworks. 

The `codeceptjs-lambdatest-service` is a CodeceptJS helper for TestMu AI (Formerly LambdaTest) that automatically updates test names and results on the TestMu AI dashboard using `_passed` and `_failed` hooks. This sample shows how to configure CodeceptJS to run on the TestMu AI cloud.

- [Sign up on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/register/) (Formerly LambdaTest).
- Follow the [CodeceptJS with Selenium on TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/codeceptjs-with-selenium/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral) for the full setup walkthrough.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- CodeceptJS installed in your project
- A TestMu AI account. Sign up for free.
- TestMu AI `Username` and `Access Key` from the TestMu AI Automation Dashboard.

### Setup

Install the service:

```bash
npm i codeceptjs-lambdatest-service --save-dev
```

Set your TestMu AI credentials as environment variables:

For **Linux/macOS**:
```bash
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

For **Windows**:
```bash
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME"
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
```

Add the `codeceptjs-lambdatest-service` helper to your `codecept.json` or `codecept.conf.js`:

```json
{
  "helper": {
    "LTHelper": {
      "require": "codeceptjs-lambdatest-service",
      "user": "process.env.LT_USERNAME",
      "key": "process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY",
      "updateTestName": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** This helper must be listed first. Use `updateTestName: true` to dynamically set the test name from test cases.

### Run tests

Run your CodeceptJS tests as usual. The service will automatically report test names and pass/fail status to the TestMu AI dashboard:

```bash
npx codeceptjs run
```

Your results will appear in the TestMu AI Automation Dashboard.

### Local testing with TestMu AI Tunnel

To test locally hosted apps, set up the TestMu AI tunnel. OS-specific guides:

- [Local Testing on Windows](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-windows/)
- [Local Testing on macOS](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-macos/)
- [Local Testing on Linux](https://www.testmuai.com/support/docs/local-testing-for-linux/)

Enable tunnel in your CodeceptJS capabilities:

```json
{
  "tunnel": true
}
```

## LambdaTest is Now TestMu AI

On **January 12, 2026**, [LambdaTest evolved to TestMu AI](https://www.testmuai.com/lambdatest-is-now-testmuai/), the world's first fully autonomous **Agentic AI Quality Engineering Platform**.

Same team. Same infrastructure. Same customer accounts. All existing LambdaTest logins, scripts, capabilities, and integrations continue to work without change.

### How LambdaTest Evolved into TestMu AI

In 2017, we launched LambdaTest with a simple mission: make testing fast, reliable, and accessible. As LambdaTest grew, we expanded into Test Intelligence, Visual Regression Testing, Accessibility Testing, API Testing, and Performance Testing, covering the full depth of the testing lifecycle.

As software development entered the AI era, testing had to evolve, too. We rebuilt the architecture to be AI-native from the ground up, with autonomous agents that **plan, author, execute, analyze, and optimize tests** while keeping humans in the loop. The platform integrates with your repos, CI, IDEs, and terminals, continuously learning from every code change and development signal.

That evolution earned a new name: **TestMu AI**, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering. TestMu is not a new name for us. It is the name of our annual community conference, which has brought together 100,000+ quality engineers to discuss how AI would reshape testing, long before that became an industry norm. 

What started as a high-performance cloud testing platform has transformed into an AI-native, multi-agent system powering a connected, end-to-end quality layer. That evolution defined a new identity: LambdaTest evolved into TestMu AI, built for an AI-first future of quality engineering.
